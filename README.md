Good day sir,

There are two directories for our submission. the directory named "presented project" is for the ANN that was simulated after
the written exam. The excel files inputTest and outputTest are the added test samples but were not included in the documentation.
Nonetheless, the ANN delivers.

The second directory named "another version of project" is a former version which separated the dataset to Train, Validation, and Test.
However, MATLAB does not output the matrices for the divided samples. therefore, the last few samples were separated and saved into
another set of excel files. this is also to avoid duplication of samples during testing. 

both projects separate the training from testing. the difference lies in the test samples that are used. we would appreciate if the other
project could help increase our grades because dataset division is more evident than the presented project.

Thank you sir,

Lopez, Reccion, Sy, Villasin
